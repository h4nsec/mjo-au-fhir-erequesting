Work is underway within RANZCR to define a Radiology Referral Reference Set. The RANZCR Radiology Referral value set included in this guide is an evolving draft that supports the latest agreed set of concepts from the Radiology Referral Reference Set. At this time the value set contains the concepts for X-Ray, Angiography and Ultrasound. Implementers are advised to take note that concepts within the value set will continue to expand and evolve when further iterations of the Radiology Referral Reference Set are available.
When work on the Radiology Referral Reference Set is complete this value set will be published in the 
[National Clinical Terminology Service (NCTS)](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir).
